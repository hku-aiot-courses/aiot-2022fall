# Intro to COMP7310 Lab

Welcome to COMP7310 Artificial Intellegence of Things. This is the lab part of this course. As regulated, you shall choose one project to finish. Our lab is composed mostly of code implemention. You are expected to read the instructions and tutorials, and then finish the tasks. This is the primary requirements. If you implement these tasks correctly, you will earn decent grades in our assignments. Besides, we provide some challenging tasks for some self-motivated students. In these tasks, you have to write multiple codes, enhance the performance of the algorithm or even transplant your sensing project to mobile devices. 

Note that we would provide support to those primary requirements at best efforts. For the advanced tasks, however, we may not offer too much help. We believe you can handle them if you fully understand the primary part.

## Grading Criteria

You shall write a report ( no more than 2 pages ) and a presentation in class. The grading criteria is thus <b>comprehensive and contribution-based</b>. We will assess your code, your report as well as your performance of presentation. Note that althogh the project is a team-based work, every student is evaluated independently. You will be asked to claim your contribution at the end of the project.

Your score in Lab part will be composed of
- 80% code: including your implemention and testing accuracy
- 10% report: your submitted 2-page report
- 10% pre: your performance of presentation 
- up to 10% bonus: optional tasks

Note that the lab overall accounts for 50% of your final grade. The other half depends on your written exam.

## Honor Code

We encourage discussions with others to clarify questions about the programming assignment problem statements. However
- Programming solutions <b>MUST BE</b> your own (your team). If we find you plagiarize, either from your classmates or Internet, you will get 0 score of this lab.
- Unless otherwise stated, <b>NEVER</b> make your remote assignment repository public


## Lab selection and workflow

The lab selection will kick-off on <b>21:00 Oct 2 (UTC+08)</b>. Before that, you are strongly advised to finish your team up and register GitHub account (If you do not have one).

You are required to click the corresponding link below (will be available after kick-off time):
-	Lab_acoustic_sensing: https://classroom.github.com/a/YZhN2wSO
-	Lab_inertial_sensing: https://classroom.github.com/a/anBzVHoS
-	Lab_wifi_localization: https://classroom.github.com/a/LwY4pz2a
-	Lab_wifi_sensing: https://classroom.github.com/a/baKlRZuj
 

Your team can pick one member to type in the team name (create a new team) and others join your team (existing team). Team name should be the specific format: XXX_XXX_XXX, where XXX represents the last 3-digit of your university ID. Note the underscore is a must since we use it to split three students. Orders do not matter. Only teams with three members should register and can be confirmed. If your team only has one or two members yet, you should wait until you find the left. 

Note: Please do not pick the wrong team. Once you join one team, it cannot be changed!

Each lab has a quota of 8 teams (It is overall enough for the whole class). If your team name is not valid or do not have three members, the team will be removed. I will review your selection continuously. If you cannot enroll, it means the lab is full for now. However, invalid teams would be removed and may empty some new space for your team.

You can start your lab after accepting the assignments. When you join the team and accept your assignments, you and your team members will see a private repository under `github.com/hku-aiot-courses` with your team name. You can use the following workflow:
- `git clone` your repositories
- Do not clone the template repository and write code there
- Collaborate with your teammates and note the version control
- When you finish, you can submit through
    - `git add .`
    - `git commit -m <commit_message>`
    - `git push origin main`


Once your team is valid and you accept one lab, you are not allowed to change.  The lab selection will be ended at <b>21:00 Oct 4 (UTC+08)</b>. Afterwards, I will export the team information and confirm the final teams. If there exists some students who do not find their team mates, I will assign randomly, to labs which have remaining positions.  Such information will be confirmed individually. 

We will finalize all the team information (including surveys) by next Friday.
