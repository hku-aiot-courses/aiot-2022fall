# Intro to COMP7310 Lab

Welcome to COMP7310 Artificial Intellegence of Things. This is the lab part of this course. As regulated, you shall choose one project to finish. Our lab is composed mostly of code implemention. You are expected to read the instructions and tutorials, and then finish the tasks. This is the primary requirements. If you implement these tasks correctly, you will earn grades of 80-90% in our assignments. Besides, we provide some challenging tasks for some self-motivated students. In these tasks, you have to write multiple codes, enhance the performance of the algorithm or even transplant your sensing project to mobile devices. 

Note that we would provide support to those primary requirements at best efforts. For the advanced tasks, however, we may not offer too much help. We believe you can handle them if you fully understand the primary part.

You shall write a report ( no more than 2 pages ) and a presentation in class. The grading criteria is thus <b>comprehensive and contribution-based</b>. We will assess your code, your report as well as your performance of presentation. Note that althogh the project is a team-based work, every student is evaluated independently. You will be asked to claim your contribution at the end of the project.

We encourage discussions with others to clarify questions about the programming assignment problem statements. However
- Programming solutions must be your own (your team). If we find you plagiarize, either from your classmates or Internet, you will get 0 score of this lab.
- <b>Do NOT</b> make your remote assignment repository public.
